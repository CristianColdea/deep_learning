# deep_learning
This is the Deep Learning specialization from Coursera. The specialization comprises a number of five courses: Neural Networks and Deep Learning; Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization; Structuring Machine Learning Projects; Convolutional Neural Networks, and Sequence Models. Only the courses with programming assignments are in the repository, without the quiz answers. The tasks are defined in the notebooks. Please note that due to files size limitations some data files are not loaded.
